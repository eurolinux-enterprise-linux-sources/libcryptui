If you want to hack or commit something to libcryptui, please first send patches to 
seahorse-list@gnome.org or submitted on bugzilla.gnome.org if possible.

For a todo list, first check bugzilla, then look at TODO. Bugzilla is also updated 
with possible enhancements and any current bugs.

Here is a description of the parts:

 o daemon: A daemon which supports the library

 o libcryptui: The library itself

DEBUGGING LIBCRYPTUI

There are a couple of configure switches that you can enable which add
debugging helpers etc...

--enable-debug 
    - Disables optimization
    - Debug info
    - Enables various checks and logging in the code.
    - Makes all Gtk|Glib etc... runtime warnings fatal.
    - Makes all compilation warnings fatal.
    
--enable-fatal-messages
    When used with --enable-debug turns on fatal compile and runtime warnings.

INDENTATION STYLE

  * No gratituous reformatting of code. If you're rewriting much of a function 
    or file it's okay to reformat it, but reformatting for the sake of it isn't 
    a good idea.

	static int 
	function (int x, const char *y) 
	{
		if (func (arg, arg2 + 1, lots, of, very, lengthy, arguments, for 
		    this, function)) {

			switch (val) {
			case XXX:
				break;
			case YYY:
				break;
			default:
				break;
			}
		} else {
			y = y * x + 1;
		}

		return func2 (x, y);
	}

  * We use tabs for indentation, and spacing to align multi-line statements.
  * Break long lines where possible.
  * Spaces between functions and arguments, or macros and arguments.
  * Spaces before and after most binary operators. 
  * Spaces after most unary operators (including a comma).
  * Brace on same line as block statement. 
  * Single lined block statements don't need braces unless it makes things 
    significantly clearer. 
  * Return value on line before function definition.
  * Brace on line after function definition.
  * '*' goes with variable not type, when declaring a pointer.
  * Function arguments follow the function call on the same line, and if 
    lengthy are (where possible) wrapped to the column of the first brace.
